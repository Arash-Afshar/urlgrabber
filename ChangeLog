	These are the changes from when ryan was working in a separate
	repo.  They are included here in bulk for ChangeLog simplicity.
	
	2004-02-09 Friday     rtomayko
	
	  * TODO: Initial commit of TODO list..
	
	2004-01-29 Thursday   rtomayko
	
	  * grabber.py, grabbertests.py, urlgrabber: Added proxy support.
	
	  * grabber.py: Removed default option copying in URLGrabber class
	    because this could cause side-effects.
	
	2004-01-25 Sunday     rtomayko
	
	  * setup.py: Fixed bad syntax on doc files..
	
	  * setup.py, urlgrabber: Added urlgrabber script to distutils
	    install.
	
	2003-12-16 Tuesday    rtomayko
	
	  * byterange.py, grabber.py: Initial crack at range support for
	    FTP - working but ugly..
	
	2003-12-12 Friday     rtomayko
	
	  * byterange.py, byterangetests.py: Make range tuples work like
	    python slices. endpos is non-inclusive.
	
	2003-12-10 Wednesday  rtomayko
	
	  * scripts/urlgrabber: Quick script to call urlgrabber from the
	    command line. I've been using it in place of wget to get as 
	    much testing as possible.
	
	  * grabber.py: Fixed small problem with progress meter not
	    updating properly. This was caused by moving _do_grab to
	    URLGrabberFileObject.
	
	  * grabber.py: Moved _do_open and per-request variables into
	    URLGrabberFileObject
	
	  * grabber.py: Added doc for user_agent kwarg
	
	  * grabber.py: Moved urllib2 Handler configuration to
	    URLGrabberFileObject. Each request has a
	    urllib2.OpenerDirector now that is customized based on
	    options.
	
	  * grabber.py: Added keepalive kwarg. keepalive can be
	    specified on a per-request basis now.
	
	  * grabber.py: Changed method of handling retries. I'm not 
	    sure if I like this yet. All URLGrabber.urlXXX methods 
	    define a function and pass it to the URLGrabber._retry() 
	    method which calls the function provided and handles 
	    retrying if the provided function raises a URLGrabError.
	
	2003-12-09 Tuesday    rtomayko
	
	  * grabber.py: default_grabber is now a default instance of 
	    URLGrabber used by the module level urlXXX functions.
	
	  * grabber.py: deprecated module level set_<option> methods.
	    default_grabber should be used instead.
	
	  * grabber.py: URLGrabber should be completely stateless now.
	    Using a single URLGrabber object for multiple requests 
	    shouldn't be a problem.
	
	  * grabber.py: Added URLGrabberOptions class to handle kwargs 
	    more elegantly.
	
	2003-12-08 Monday   rtomayko
	
	  * __init__.py, setup.py: everything should be in a package named
	    urlgrabber now (distutils is a nice piece of software).
	
	  * grabber.py, range.py, rangetests.py, grabbertests.py: - Initial
	    attempt at range support for HTTP and local files through range
	    module.
	
	  * byterange.py: brought in skeleton classes from urllib2 for FTP 
	    range support but FTP ranges are not yet supported.
	
	  * byterange.py: Local file range support internally implemented 
	    with RangeableFileObject which is a pretty cool file object 
	    wrapper that automatically handles ranging.
	
	2003-12-07 Sunday   rtomayko
	
	  * grabber.py: minor changes for line wrapping
	
	  * grabber.py: added URLGrabber class (moved _do_open, _do_grab,
	    _parse_url, _get_raw_throttle into said class).
	
	  * grabber.py: deprecated retrygrab. now supported through
	    urlgrab(retry=n).
	
	  * grabber.py: local filenames (i.e. without URL scheme 
	    specifier) are now handled wherever a url may be passed.
	
	  * grabber.py: retry is now fully supported on urlread and 
	    partially supported on urlopen. wrt to urlopen, retries are 
	    possible if an URLGrabError occurs while _opening_ the url 
	    (e.g. due to temporarily unavailable, etc). however, we 
	    still can't protect anyone from problems that occur after 
	    urlopen has returned the file object.
	
	2003-12-05 Friday   rtomayko
	
	  * grabber.py: Initial attempt at retooling the interface to use
	    kwargs.. *Most* functionality should still be working..
