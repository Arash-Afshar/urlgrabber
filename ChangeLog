	* TODO, urlgrabber/keepalive.py:

	[TODO] added not about restructuring import style

	[keepalive.py] improved exception-handling and made it a bit more
	fault-tolerant.  Specifically, it now better addresses
	dropped-connections.  Also added a dropped-connection test to the
	test code in keepalive.py.  For now, I'd like to keep this code in
	keepalive.py for convenient diagnostics from users.

	* TODO, test/test_mirror.py, urlgrabber/grabber.py,
	urlgrabber/keepalive.py, urlgrabber/mirror.py:

	Added mirror code and associated test code.

	[grabber.py] Edited URLGrabError doc string to reflect MirrorGroup
	error code and new error code policy.

	[TODO] Moved reget to ALPHA (from ALPHA 2)

	[keepalive.py] fixed problem with the new python 2.3 httplib.  They
	now raise BadStatusLine from a new place.

2004-03-09 23:18  Ryan Tomayko <rtomayko@naeblis.cx>

	* test/: grabberperf.py, test_byterange.py, test_grabber.py:

	Fixed up tests to work with new directory layout.  Note: most
	sys.path hackery has been removed so you will need	 to setup
	PYTHONPATH manually before running test scripts.

2004-03-09 23:08  Ryan Tomayko <rtomayko@naeblis.cx>

	* setup.py:

	Fixed up for new cvs structure. Tried to simplify a bit while I was
	here.

2004-03-09 22:08  Michael Stenner <mstenner@linux.duke.edu>

	* ChangeLog:

	Edited the cvs repo to restructure a little bit.  All module python
	code (grabber.py, byterange.py, progress.py, keepalive.py, and
	__init__.py) have been moved into a "urlgrabber" directory.

	Removed the ChangeLog file from the repo and created a new empty
	one.  In the intial (empty) version, I included the old logs from
	before the repo-merge.	Therefore, those logs appear as a single
	log-entry.  It's a little bit of a hack, but it's good enough.	All
	the info is there, and it allows us to move forward without having
	to keep special-casing those old logs.

	All future changelogs will be generated with cvs2cs.pl.

	Other than these actions, I didn't do anything to any files.
	Therefore, a number of things are certainly broken, as they expect
	things to be in other places.  Things I can think of: test code,
	setup.py.

	2004-02-09 Friday     rtomayko

	  * TODO: Initial commit of TODO list..

	2004-01-29 Thursday   rtomayko

	  * grabber.py, grabbertests.py, urlgrabber: Added proxy support.

	  * grabber.py: Removed default option copying in URLGrabber class
	    because this could cause side-effects.

	2004-01-25 Sunday     rtomayko

	  * setup.py: Fixed bad syntax on doc files..

	  * setup.py, urlgrabber: Added urlgrabber script to distutils
	    install.

	2003-12-16 Tuesday    rtomayko

	  * byterange.py, grabber.py: Initial crack at range support for
	    FTP - working but ugly..

	2003-12-12 Friday     rtomayko

	  * byterange.py, byterangetests.py: Make range tuples work like
	    python slices. endpos is non-inclusive.

	2003-12-10 Wednesday  rtomayko

	  * scripts/urlgrabber: Quick script to call urlgrabber from the
	    command line. I've been using it in place of wget to get as
	    much testing as possible.

	  * grabber.py: Fixed small problem with progress meter not
	    updating properly. This was caused by moving _do_grab to
	    URLGrabberFileObject.

	  * grabber.py: Moved _do_open and per-request variables into
	    URLGrabberFileObject

	  * grabber.py: Added doc for user_agent kwarg

	  * grabber.py: Moved urllib2 Handler configuration to
	    URLGrabberFileObject. Each request has a
	    urllib2.OpenerDirector now that is customized based on
	    options.

	  * grabber.py: Added keepalive kwarg. keepalive can be
	    specified on a per-request basis now.

	  * grabber.py: Changed method of handling retries. I'm not
	    sure if I like this yet. All URLGrabber.urlXXX methods
	    define a function and pass it to the URLGrabber._retry()
	    method which calls the function provided and handles
	    retrying if the provided function raises a URLGrabError.

	2003-12-09 Tuesday    rtomayko

	  * grabber.py: default_grabber is now a default instance of
	    URLGrabber used by the module level urlXXX functions.

	  * grabber.py: deprecated module level set_<option> methods.
	    default_grabber should be used instead.

	  * grabber.py: URLGrabber should be completely stateless now.
	    Using a single URLGrabber object for multiple requests
	    shouldn't be a problem.

	  * grabber.py: Added URLGrabberOptions class to handle kwargs
	    more elegantly.

	2003-12-08 Monday   rtomayko

	  * __init__.py, setup.py: everything should be in a package named
	    urlgrabber now (distutils is a nice piece of software).

	  * grabber.py, range.py, rangetests.py, grabbertests.py: - Initial
	    attempt at range support for HTTP and local files through range
	    module.

	  * byterange.py: brought in skeleton classes from urllib2 for FTP
	    range support but FTP ranges are not yet supported.

	  * byterange.py: Local file range support internally implemented
	    with RangeableFileObject which is a pretty cool file object
	    wrapper that automatically handles ranging.

	2003-12-07 Sunday   rtomayko

	  * grabber.py: minor changes for line wrapping

	  * grabber.py: added URLGrabber class (moved _do_open, _do_grab,
	    _parse_url, _get_raw_throttle into said class).

	  * grabber.py: deprecated retrygrab. now supported through
	    urlgrab(retry=n).

	  * grabber.py: local filenames (i.e. without URL scheme
	    specifier) are now handled wherever a url may be passed.

	  * grabber.py: retry is now fully supported on urlread and
	    partially supported on urlopen. wrt to urlopen, retries are
	    possible if an URLGrabError occurs while _opening_ the url
	    (e.g. due to temporarily unavailable, etc). however, we
	    still can't protect anyone from problems that occur after
	    urlopen has returned the file object.

	2003-12-05 Friday   rtomayko

	  * grabber.py: Initial attempt at retooling the interface to use
	    kwargs.. *Most* functionality should still be working..

2003-10-12 17:21  Michael Stenner <mstenner@linux.duke.edu>

	* urlgrabber.py, test/test_urlgrabber.py:

	created test_urlgrabber.py and started moving tests into it
