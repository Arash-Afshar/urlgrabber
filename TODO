ALPHA:

  * Implement MirrorGroups.

  * Basic speed tests to make sure we're not insanely slow. Interested 
    in the cases of:
    - crazy features ON and large files
    - crazy features ON and small files 
    - crazy features OFF and large files
    - crazy features OFF and small files
    
    Here, crazy features are things like throttling and progress meters.
    The significance of large/small files is whether we're slow in the 
    actual downloading or the setup overhead.

  * urlread needs to support checkfunc (pass in the string itself).

ALPHA 2:

  * Handle non-satisfiable ranges. e.g. due to a server not supporting ranges 
    or a requested range being invalid. Right now the result of either of 
    these two cases is undefined and is probably different for HTTP/FTP.
    Raising an exception seems to be "the right thing to do" in both cases.

  * Need to test usage across multiple threads. grabber.py should be fine.
    keepalive seems to be the scary piece here.

  * Consider adding timeout keyword arg that would handle setting the socket
    timeout natively under python 2.3 or using timeoutsocket.py hack if 
    available and using python < 2.3.

  * Clean up conditionals checking for urllib2 availability. Assume urllib2 
    is available.

  * Test proxy support with authenticating proxies (http and ftp).   

  * FTP proxy testing in general.

  * Evaluate FTP range implementation. Problem here is that we had to
    duplicate quite a bit of code from urllib/urllib2 to make this work
    with the current implementation. We need to accept it and tidy it up a 
    bit or pitch it for something better. I've wracked my head trying to
    find a better way of doing this. Too much urllib2 source is bad for
    the head.

  * The FTP REST command does not support specifying an end-byte like HTTP's
    Range header. Currently, we are  calling close() on the file object when 
    the last byte of a range is received. Is there a cleaner way of handling 
    this? Need to verify that the FTP session is being shut down cleanly and
    the connection is closed properly.

  * Have a plan for KeyboardInterupt exception handling. This is driven by 
    recent chatter on the yum list about Ctrl-C handling. Seth suggests 
    Ctrl-C as a "Skip to Next Mirror" trigger when processing MirrorGroups.

Misc:

  * Need to get a on-commit-email script working for urlgrabber CVS. While 
    we're talking about operational type stuff, we should also get viewcvs 
    setup.
